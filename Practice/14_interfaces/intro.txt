01. What is interface?

02. Multiple inheritence VS Interfaces (java doesn't have multiple inheritence but it achieved bt interface)
03. Example of  interface?


=>Interface is completely used for achieving polymorphism.
=> classes are extended but interfaces are implemented
=> when we exten then a class will always extend from only one class
=> But in interfaces an class  is implemented from multiple interface that help in achieving polymorphism
=> We can create references of interface but cannot create the object of interface.
=> Interfaces are used for CallBack Method.
=CallBack method is formally used in event handling.



04. Do's & Don't of interface?

=> we can make the methods of interface public and abstract but not private becouse they are sippose to be implemented by the classes

=>Interface abstract method cannot have body but a interface can have static method with body

=>Identifier can be obtained by interface name with dot(.) operator.

=>we can gate static member with interface name without creating object of interface method.

=> if i have to modify the interface in between then we should use (default) that could not disturb the other classes that are implemented priviously 

=> if i modify the interface in between then the class that are implemented previously become abstract class.

=> We can create private method inside interface but not use outside

=>Private methods in interfaces are only accessible within the interface itself.
=>Only public and default methods in interfaces can be overridden by implementing classes.
=>Static methods in interfaces also cannot be overridden.
