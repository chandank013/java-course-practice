# Type of Inner Class

01. Nested Inner Class  (class inside another class cannot directly access outside the classes)
02. Local Inner Class  (Class inside a method uses when a class is inherit from existing class and mplementing from interface)
03. Anonymous Inner class  (It is defined at the time of creation of object itself useful for interfaces and abstract classes)
04. static inner class  ( it is ststic member of outer class {static class uses only static member of outer classnot other member}. it can also direclty access out side outer class)


Note:
01. We can use inner class by creating object inside the outrer class
02. we cannot using member of inner class directly but we can use by creatig object in outer class
03. we also cannot use the inner class outside the outer class
