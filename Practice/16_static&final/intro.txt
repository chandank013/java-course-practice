                                    Static 
    => (Static keyword is used for meta data i.e information of a class and used as shared data among all members of the class, it is created inside method area)



01. Static Variable
02. Static Method
03. Static Nested class
04. Static Blocks  (Utilise during the setup notcommonly used and main method get executed after execution of all static block)


Note: 01.Only inner class will be static can inherited.

    Example:
    class Outer 
    {
        static class Inner { }
    }

    class SubInner extends Outer.Inner { }


    02 No, static methods cannot be overridden in Java.
    03 If you declare a static method with the same name in a subclass, it is called method hiding, not overriding.
    The version called depends on the reference type, not the object type.
    Example:

    class A 
    {
    static void show() { System.out.println("A"); }
    }
    class B extends A 
    {
    static void show() { System.out.println("B"); }
    }

    public class Demo {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            A.show(); // prints "A"
            B.show(); // prints "B"
            A a = new B();
            a.show(); // prints "A" (not "B")
        }
    }
    04 static member only access the static variable
    05 this(), super() keyword cannot be used under the static method


                            final
        
    => final is same as constant in java.
    => Once value assign the cannot be modify.
    => inside method first final should be initalisd then assign take place for printing
    => three method of initialisation of final is directly initalised (final float PI=3.14f;), inside the constructor  (public FinalDemo(){PI=3.1425f;})
    and inside the instance;


01. final Variable
02. final Method
03. final class


Note: 01 final method cannot be override
Note: 02 final class cannot be inherited



                        Singleton class 

    => the class that create single object more than one object of class is not allowed.
    =>
