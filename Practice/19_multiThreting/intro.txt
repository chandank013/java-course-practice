                    # MultiThreading (multiple things work simultaneously in a single application)

01. MultiProgramming.
02. Why MultiThreading.
03. Control flow of a MultiProgramming.
04. Thread in Java.


# MultiThreading in Java:
=> there are ttwo class that used to achive multithreating
 01.Thread class (actual machanism are present in this).
 02.Runnable Interface 

=> If we want achiving multithreating then our class must extend from Thread and impplements Runnable Interface.
=> whenever we want to extends the thread class and want to achive multithreading we must override run method.
=> Run method is starting point of thread. and having actual functionality of thread class.


# Thread class (having many methods)
01. Constructors
02. getxxx()/setxxx()
03. Enquiry
04. Instence method
05. Static methods


# Synchronisation
=>Synchronization is a mechanism in Java to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. It prevents data inconsistency and thread interference by allowing only one thread to access a critical section (shared code or data) at a time

#Why Synchronization?

When multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously, it can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results.
Synchronization ensures that only one thread can execute a synchronized block or method at a time.



01. Mutex = Thread itself know how to read and write.
02. Shemaphora = Thread know how to read and write but locking and unlocking governed by operating system.
03. Monitor = Object itself take responsibility of mutual exclusion. Object will decide who will access or governed the locking and unlocking system. 



# Inner Thread
=>  One will waiting all other until get the set value by One then after One can change .
