                # Java.lang Package
# Object class

=> Object class is parent class of all class in java.
=> Any object directly and indirectly inheriting form Object class becouse on creating object of any class having same methods

# Wrapper Class 
=> That make a wrapper around a premitive data type with the help of referances and make Object.


# String => Immutable
# String Buffer => mutable , Thread Save mean Two Thread cannot be utilise te same string buffer object simultaneously.
# String Builder => mutable(Same as String Buffer but it allow more than two thread to enter inside  and call the method and modify)


                    # Enum
=> An enum in Java is a special data type that allows you to define a set of named constants. It is used to represent a fixed set of related values, such as days of the week, directions, or departments.

Key Points:

Enums are type-safe and can have fields, methods, and constructors.
Each value in an enum is an object (instance) of the enum type.
Enums can be used in switch statements and compared using ==.
Enums improve code readability and reduce errors from invalid values.



Reflection in Java

Reflection is a feature in Java that allows a program to examine and manipulate the runtime behavior of classes, interfaces, fields, and methods. It is part of the java.lang.reflect package.

What does reflection do?

Allows you to inspect class structure (fields, methods, constructors) at runtime.
Enables dynamic creation of objects, method invocation, and field access, even if you don’t know their names at compile time.
Useful for frameworks, libraries, debuggers, and tools that need to work with classes dynamically (like IDEs, dependency injection, serialization, etc.).
