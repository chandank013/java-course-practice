Lambda Expression Introduction (Java)

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. Lambda expressions are used primarily to define the implementation of a functional interface (an interface with a single abstract method) in a clear and concise way.

Key Points:

Introduced in Java 8.
Provides a way to write anonymous methods (functions) in Java.
Makes code more readable and concise, especially for functional programming and working with collections.
Syntax:
(parameters) -> { body }
Example:

// Traditional way
Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
};

// Using lambda expression
Runnable r2 = () -> System.out.println("Hello");

Summary:
Lambda expressions simplify the implementation of functional interfaces, making Java code shorter and more expressive.



Method References in Java

A method reference is a shorthand notation of a lambda expression to call a method directly. It is used to refer to a method without executing it. Method references make code more concise and readable, especially when the lambda expression only calls an existing method

Syntax:
ClassName::methodName
object::methodName
ClassName::new   // for constructor reference


Types of Method References:

Reference to a static method:
ClassName::staticMethod
Reference to an instance method of a particular object:
object::instanceMethod
Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type:
ClassName::instanceMethod
Reference to a constructor:
ClassName::new
