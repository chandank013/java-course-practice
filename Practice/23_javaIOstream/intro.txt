# Java I/O Streams Notes

## What are Streams?
- Streams are sequences of data.
- Java I/O (Input/Output) uses streams to read and write data (bytes or characters).

## Types of Streams
1. **Byte Streams**
   - Handle raw binary data.
   - Classes: `InputStream`, `OutputStream` (and subclasses like `FileInputStream`, `FileOutputStream`).

2. **Character Streams**
   - Handle character data (text).
   - Classes: `Reader`, `Writer` (and subclasses like `FileReader`, `FileWriter`).

## Common Classes

| Class                | Description                        |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| FileInputStream      | Reads bytes from a file            |
| FileOutputStream     | Writes bytes to a file             |
| FileReader           | Reads characters from a file       |
| FileWriter           | Writes characters to a file        |
| BufferedReader       | Reads text efficiently             |
| BufferedWriter       | Writes text efficiently            |
| DataInputStream      | Reads primitive data types         |
| DataOutputStream     | Writes primitive data types        |
| ObjectInputStream    | Reads objects (serialization)      |
| ObjectOutputStream   | Writes objects (serialization)     |

## Basic Usage Example

```java
// Writing to a file
FileWriter writer = new FileWriter("output.txt");
writer.write("Hello, world!");
writer.close();

// Reading from a file
BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("output.txt"));
String line = reader.readLine();
reader.close();
```

## Important Points
- Always close streams to free resources (`close()` method).
- Use try-with-resources for automatic closing.
- Buffered streams improve performance.
- Streams can be chained for advanced operations.

## Try-with-Resources Example

```java
try (FileReader fr = new FileReader("file.txt");
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr)) {
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
}
```

## Summary
- Use byte streams for binary data.
- Use character streams for text.
- Always handle


Serialization in Java is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, so that it can be easily saved to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database. This byte stream can later be deserialized to recreate the original object in memory.

It is used for persistent storage and communication.
To serialize an object, the class must implement the Serializable interface.
Example:
Deserialization is the reverse process—converting the byte stream back into an object.
