1. Definition
Generics in Java allow you to write classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for types (type parameters).
They provide compile-time type safety and eliminate the need for casting.

Example:
ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();

2. Bounds on Generics
Upper Bound: Restricts the type to a subclass of a specific class.

Example 
class Box<T extends Number> { ... }

Here, T can be Number or its subclasses (Integer, Double, etc.).

Lower Bound: Restricts the type to a superclass of a specific class.
void addNumbers(List<? super Integer> list) { ... }

Here, the list can accept Integer or its superclasses.

3. Generic Methods
You can define methods with their own type parameters.

Example:
public <T> void printArray(T[] array) {
    for (T element : array) {
        System.out.println(element);
    }
}

4. Do's and Don'ts
Do's:

Use generics to ensure type safety.
Use bounded types when you need to restrict type parameters.
Use generic methods for reusable code.
Don'ts:

Don't use primitive types as type parameters (use Integer instead of int).
Don't use generic arrays (e.g., T[] arr = new T[10]; is not allowed).
Don't mix raw types and parameterized types (avoid List list = new ArrayList<String>();).
