1. Introduction

Introduced in Java 8 (java.time package).
Replaces old java.util.Date, java.util.Calendar, and related classes.
Provides a modern, immutable, and thread-safe approach to date and time handling.



2. Key Classes

Class	Purpose
LocalDate	Date without time (YYYY-MM-DD)
LocalTime	Time without date (HH:MM:SS)
LocalDateTime	Date and time without timezone
ZonedDateTime	Date and time with timezone
Instant	Timestamp (machine time, UTC)
Period	Amount of time in years, months, days
Duration	Amount of time in seconds, nanoseconds
DateTimeFormatter	Formatting and parsing date/time


4. Advantages

Immutable: All classes are immutable and thread-safe.
Clear API: Easy to read and use.
Time Zone Support: Handles time zones and offsets.
No More Deprecated Methods: Avoids confusion of old APIs.
5. Common Pitfalls
Do not mix old (Date, Calendar) and new (java.time) APIs.
Use DateTimeFormatter for custom parsing/formatting.
Use ZonedDateTime for time zone-specific operations.


Here are the main disadvantages of the old java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar APIs:

Disadvantages of java.util.Date and java.util.Calendar
Mutable Objects:
Both Date and Calendar are mutable, making them unsafe for use in multi-threaded environments.

Poor API Design:
Many confusing and inconsistent method names (e.g., months are zero-based, years are offset from 1900).

Lack of Time Zone Support:
Time zone handling is limited and error-prone.

Deprecated Methods:
Several methods are deprecated, leading to confusion and warnings.

No Immutability:
Changes to a Date or Calendar object can affect other code that references the same object.

Limited Formatting and Parsing:
Formatting and parsing dates and times is cumbersome and not thread-safe.

Difficult Arithmetic:
Adding or subtracting dates and times is not straightforward.
