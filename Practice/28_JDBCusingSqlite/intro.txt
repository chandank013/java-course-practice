JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) Notes

1. Introduction
JDBC is an API in Java for connecting and executing queries with databases.
It allows Java applications to interact with relational databases in a platform-independent way.

2. Key Components
DriverManager: Manages a list of database drivers and establishes a connection to the database.
Connection: Represents a session with a specific database.
Statement: Used to execute SQL queries (static SQL).
PreparedStatement: Used for executing precompiled SQL queries with parameters (dynamic SQL).

ResultSet: Represents the result set of a query, allowing data retrieval.
SQLException: Handles database access errors.


3. JDBC Architecture
Four-tier architecture: Application → JDBC API → JDBC Driver Manager → JDBC Driver → Database.
JDBC drivers translate Java calls into database-specific calls.


4. Types of JDBC Drivers
Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
Type 2: Native-API Driver
Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
Type 4: Thin Driver (Pure Java, most commonly used)


5. JDBC Workflow
Load the database driver.
Establish a connection to the database.
Create a statement or prepared statement.
Execute SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Process the results (if any).
Close the connection and resources.


6. Advantages
Platform-independent database access.
Supports multiple databases (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.).
Secure and robust with support for transactions and batch processing.


7. Best Practices
Always close connections, statements, and result sets to avoid resource leaks.
Use PreparedStatement to prevent SQL injection.
Handle exceptions using try-catch blocks.
Use connection pooling for better performance in large applications.


8. Summary
JDBC is the standard Java API for database connectivity.
It provides a uniform interface for accessing different relational databases.
Proper resource management and security practices are essential for effective JDBC programming.
